The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the client's clock is significantly out of sync with the Firebase servers. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with timestamps and security rules.  For example, a write operation might be rejected because the client's timestamp is considered too old or too far in the future.
